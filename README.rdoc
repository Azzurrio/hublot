= \Hublot

Hublot makes Facebook-style datetime-contextual datetimes a cinch for your ActiveRecord objects. 

== Use

    gem "hublot", "~> 0.0.5"
  
Call the pretty method in your views:

    <%= @comment.created_at.pretty %>
    
Hublot extends ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone, so the pretty method will work on any field of that class, 
like the defaults baked into ActiveRecord, created_at and updated_at. 

Hublot does not currently support other ORMs.
